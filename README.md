# Interactive Rebase

Interactive rebase is like the swiss army knife of good commands, lots of use cases and a lot of possibilities
Interactive rebase allows you to manipulate your commit history.

It rewrites your commit history so the new commits you manipulate will have new hash IDs.

## What you can do with Interactive Rebase.

- Change commit's message
- Delete commits
- Reorder commits
- Combine multiple commits into one
- Edit/Split an existing commit into multiple ones.

<code>N/B</code>

DO NOT use interactive rebase on commits that you've already pushed/shared on remote repository!

Instead , use it for cleaning up your local commit history before merging into a shared team branch.
